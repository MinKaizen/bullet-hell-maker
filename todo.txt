- WORKFLOW for designers
	- Basically, create a container scene for testing patterns
	- I want to be able to save patterns that I like
- What should be set in the bullet SCENE?
	- sprite
	- size
	- collision mask
	- (flag) rotate sprite based on direction
	- Basically the look and the size
- Where should bullet params be set?
	- At the pattern level, via a BulletOptions resource or something
- refactor:
	- resource: bullet params
	- resource: pattern params
	- (pattern is a group of bullets, basically what our current emitter is doing)
	- From the inspector, I want to be able to
		- select a bullet SCENE
		- adjust the pattern (same as our current emitter scene)
- Targeting (e.g. bullets that follow or semi-follow the player or some other target)
- Damping (reduces speed until 0)
- Phases
	- phase end after duration
	- phase end after collision
	- phase end after param == somevalue
- Bullets explode? On death? after phase ends?


Design Decisions:
- Patterns do not control bullets in 2nd+ order phases.
- Bullets spawned during phases are controlled by the previous bullet (not the pattern)

Bullet Init (at run time):
These are values that are set by the pattern at run time. You can't (directly) set these values in the inspector
- position
- direction

Pattern Init (at run time):
Values that are set by the character (e.g. on a timer, on actions). You can't set these (directly) in the inspector
- position
- direction
